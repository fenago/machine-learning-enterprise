#### Exercise 2.1



For each of the following scenarios, state if it is an example of
supervised or unsupervised learning. Explain your answers. In cases of
ambiguity, pick one, and explain why you picked it.


1. A recommendation system on a social network that recommends
    potential friends to a user
2. A system in a news site that divides the news into topics
3. The Google autocomplete feature for sentences
4. A recommendation system on an online retailer that recommends to
    users what to buy based on their past purchasing history
5. A system in a credit card company that captures fraudulent
    transactions


#### Exercise 2.2



For each of the following applications of machine learning, would you
use regression or classification to solve it? Explain your answers. In
cases of ambiguity, pick one, and explain why you picked it.


1. An online store predicting how much money a user will spend on
    their site
2. A voice assistant decoding voice and turning it into text
3. Selling or buying stock from a particular company
4. YouTube recommending a video to a user


#### Exercise 2.3



Your task is to build a self-driving car. Give at least three examples
of machine learning problems that you would have to solve to build it.
In each example, explain if you are using supervised/unsupervised
learning, and, if supervised, whether you are using regression or
classification. If you are using other types of machine learning,
explain which ones, and why.
